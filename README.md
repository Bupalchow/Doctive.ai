# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis Web Application

Welcome to our AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis Web Application! This project aims to provide users with a user-friendly platform to input their symptoms, receive an instant diagnosis, and potentially gain valuable insights into their health conditions. Using PyWebIO, we've transformed our model into an interactive web application, making healthcare more accessible and efficient.

## Features

We have a list of symptoms, Using the PyWebIO we have to convert our model into a web-application. It should allow a patient to come to it, enter his/her details and symptoms one by one and get a diagnosis and if possible. It is implemented using a decision tree.

- **Symptom-Based Diagnosis:** Our web application allows users to enter their symptoms one by one, providing an intuitive and comprehensive process for inputting information.

- **Rapid Results:** Through the power of machine learning, our application quickly processes the provided symptoms and generates a potential diagnosis using a decision tree algorithm.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** We've designed the interface to be easy to navigate, ensuring that even users without technical knowledge can utilize our application seamlessly.
